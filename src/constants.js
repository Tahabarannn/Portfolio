  pc: `This is my PC. These days I am mostly interested in Theoretical courses and C++.
  I have done projects with languages like Java, Python and JavaScript.
  Anyway regardless of the language, I just like programming.
  So please don't give me feedback that it is not good, it is not right to deal with so many things.
  I JUST LOVE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY!

  It was a very theoretical degree but I think it gave me a good foundation.`,
